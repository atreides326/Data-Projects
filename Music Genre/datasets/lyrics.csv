"Right outside of this one church town
There's a gold dirt road to a whole lot of nothing
Got a deed to the land but it ain't my ground
This is God's country
We pray for rain and thank Him when it's fallin'
'Cause it brings a grain and a little bit of money
We put it back in a plate, I guess that's why they call it
God's country
I saw the light in a sunrise
Sittin' back in a 40 on the muddy river side
Gettin' baptized in holy water and shine with the dogs runnin'
Saved by the sound of the being found
Dixie whistle in the wind, that'll get you Heaven bound
The devil went down to Georgia but he didn't stick around
This is God's country
We turn the dirt and work until the week's done
We take a break and break bread on Sunday
Then do it all again 'cause we're proud to be
From God's country (Yeah)
I saw the light in a sunrise
Sittin' back in a 40 on the muddy river side
Gettin' baptized in holy water and shine with the dogs runnin'
Saved by the sound of the being found
Dixie whistle in the wind, that'll get you Heaven bound
The devil went down to Georgia but he didn't stick around
This is God's country
I don't care what my headstone reads
Or what kind of pine wood box I end up in
When it's my time lay me 6 feet deep in
God's country
I saw the light in a sunrise
Sittin' back in a 40 on the muddy river side
Gettin' baptized in holy water and shine with the dogs runnin'
Saved by the sound of the being found
Dixie whistle in the wind, that'll get you Heaven bound
The devil went down to Georgia but he didn't stick around
This is God's country
Yeah, I saw the light in a sunrise
Sittin' back in a 40 on the muddy river side
Gettin' baptized in holy water and shine with the dogs runnin'
Saved by the sound of the being found
Dixie whistle in the wind, that'll get you Heaven bound
The devil went down to Georgia but he didn't stick around
This is God's country",Country,God's country,Blake Shelton
"Pour me, pour me another drink
Cause I don't wanna feel a thing
No more, hell nah
I just wanna sip it til the pain wears off
Pour me, pour me another round
Line'em up and knock'em down
Two more, let's go
Cause I ain't ever hurt like this before
Don't wanna think about her, or wear a ring without her
Don't wanna hit the karaoke bar, can't sing without her
So make them drinks strong, cause brother she's gone
And if I'm ever gonna move on
I'ma need some whiskey glasses
Cause I don't wanna see the truth
She's probly makin' out on the couch right now with someone new
Yea I'ma need some whiskey glasses
If I'm gonna make it through
If I'ma be single I'ma need a double shot of that heartbreak proof
And see the world through whiskey glasses
See the world through whiskey glasses
Last call, I swear this'll be my last call
Now I ain't drunk dialin' no more at 3am
Mr. Bartender hit me again
Don't wanna think about her, or wear a ring without her
Don't wanna hit the karaoke bar, can't sing without her
So make them drinks strong, cause brother she's gone

"Girl you know I've known you forever
How many nights have we hung out together
Same little crowd, little bar, little town
Round this old dance floor
My boys are laughing and tap me on the shoulder
Making a motion like ""'Could y'all get any closer?""
They wanna know what's up when I'm still holding ya
Even when the song is over
There's a rumor going round about me and you
Stirring up our little town the last week or two
So tell me why we even trying to deny this feeling
I feel it, don't you feel it too?
There's a rumor going round, and round, and round
What you say we make it true?
We make it true
Well I can shut 'em down, tell them all they're crazy
I can do whatever you want me to do, baby
Or you could lay one on me right now
We could really give them something to talk about
There's a rumor going round about me and you
Stirring up our little town the last week or two
So tell me why we even trying to deny this feeling
I feel it, don't you feel it too?
There's a rumor going round, and round, and round
What you say we make it true, baby?
Oh be honest girl now
Do you want to do this or not?
Should we keep 'em talking, girl
Or should we just make them stop?
There's a rumor going round about me and you
Stirring up our little town the last week or two
Tell me why we even trying to deny this feeling
I feel it, and you feel it too
There's a rumor going round, and round, and round
What you say we make it...
Make it true?
What you say we make it true? Yeah",Country,Rumor,Lee Brice
"I've had a largemouth bass bust my line
A couple beautiful girls tell me goodbye
Trucks break down, dogs run off
Politicians lie, been fired by the boss

It takes one hand to count the things I can count on
No, there ain't much, man, that ain't never let me down

Long neck ice cold beer never broke my heart
Like diamond rings and football teams have torn this boy apart
Like a neon dream, it just dawned on me, that bars and this guitar
And long neck ice cold beer never broke my heart

She was a Carolina blue jean baby
Fire in her eyes that drove me crazy
It was red taillights when she left town
If I didn't know then, I sure know now

But long neck ice cold beer never broke my heart
Like diamond rings and football teams have torn this boy apart
Like a neon dream, it just dawned on me, that bars and this guitar
And long neck ice cold beer never broke my heart

It takes one hand to count the things I can count on
But I got one hand that's gripping down on a cold one

'Cause long neck ice cold beer never broke my heart
Like diamond rings and football teams have torn this boy apart
Like a neon dream, it just dawned on me, that bars and this guitar
And long neck ice cold beer never broke my heart, no
It never broke my heart",Country,Beer Never Broke My Heart,Luke Combs
"Don't even want the attention
But yeah, that's all that she's getting
Her song is on and she's spinning around, yeah
She got me drunk like Corona
Heart racing like it's Daytona
Ooh, I'm in Heaven I swear right now

And those eyes can hypnotize
Was designed to blow my mind

Look what God gave her, how perfect He made her
She walks in the room, it's like He answered my prayers
The way that she moves, how could anybody blame her?
I know she's got haters, but it ain't her fault, nah
Look what God gave her

It's like I heard angels singing
Like she came down from the ceiling
When she walked in here this evening, I thought, yeah
That girl, one in seven billion
Got everyone in here feeling
Like there's a fire in this building, so hot

Got a smile on her angel face
I know I'll never lose my faith

Look what God gave her, how perfect He made her
She walks in the room, it's like He answered my prayers
The way that she moves, how could anybody blame her?
I know she's got haters, but it ain't her fault, nah
Look what God gave her

Got that look in her eyes
Swear she fell right out the sky
Yeah, I think I've seen the light
Every kiss, I could die
It's like the Heavens opened wide
Man, I swear I've seen the light, oh

Look what God gave her, how perfect He made her
She walks in the room, it's like He answered my prayers
The way that she moves, how could anybody blame her?
I know she's got haters, but it ain't her fault, nah
Look what God gave her

Look what God gave her

"This truck needs a half tank
These wheels need a two lane
This radio needs three songs to play

Yeah birds need bees and ice needs whiskey

Boots need knockin', knockin' boots

Knockin' boots, me and you, oh

Long weeks need a weekend
Cheap drinks need a slingin'
That dance floor needs some me on you

Tip bells need to be rung
Last calls need to call that cab

"Man, this shit's unflatterin', all up in my head again
I don't feel myself right now, maybe I should just lay down
If vanity's my vitamin, well, I don't feel the difference
I don't like myself right now, gotta find a way out

What you feel is natural

"Beer don't keep
Love's not cheap
And trucks don't wreck themselves
Mama ain't a shrink
Daddy ain't a bank
And God ain't a wishin' well

Money ain't rich
Everybody sins
And nobody wins in a fight
And sometimes wrong is right

Some of it you learn the hard way
Some of it you read on a page
Some of it comes from heartbreak
Most of it comes with age

And none of it ever comes easy
A bunch of it you maybe can't use
I know I don't probably know what I think I do
But there's somethin' to
Some of it

Girls like to laugh
Tears don't last
And scared's what praying's for
If it's close, swing the bat
Everybody's gotta pass
And love's worth living for

When you dance, hold her close
'Til it breaks, go for broke
Be the first to reach for her hand
No, you don't get to do some things again

Some of it you learn the hard way
Some of it you read on a page
Some of it comes from heartbreak
Most of it comes with age
And none of it ever comes easy
A bunch of it you maybe can't use
I know I don't probably know what I think I do
But there's somethin' to
Some of it

When you can, take it slow
'Cause time sure won't
What really makes you a man
Is being true to her 
'Til your glass runs out of sand

Some of it you learn the hard way
Some of it you read on a page
Some of it comes from heartbreak
Most of it comes with age
And none of it ever comes easy
A bunch of it you maybe can't use
I know I don't probably know what I think I do
But there's somethin' to
Some of it

I had to, I just had to

You can leave me sitting right here

Flee the scene, put your feet on my dash

Lost in that last goodbye, what if time doesn't do what it's supposed to do?
What if I never get over you?

I still call and wait 'til the tone
Just to hear you saying, ""Leave a message.""

Since you've been gone I've had to find
Different ways to grieve.
There's days that I don't even want it on my mind,
But tonight I'm weak.

"We were just a couple years short of the age by my name on a fake ID
And still, 'bout a hundred away from the day your daddy said you could run with me
We were a couple of line-steppers who just couldn't wait to step over the line
Never thinking we wouldn't last, I was your first and you were mine

And we were leather jackets, hangin' on to a Harley, two heartbeats in the moonlight
We were, both feet hanging out over the edge of the water tower skyline
At least there's a little bit of sweet in the bitter, though a part of me is always gonna miss it
I am who I am, I just miss who I was when we were

We were gonna make it work, little baby had it all laid out in her mind
By the time we knew time was running out we'd done run out of time
But we were downtown Saturday night, last call, cover band
'Til the last song played, never thought we'd fade like the stamp on the back of her hand

We were, her on my shoulders, lighter in the air, pour some sugar on me
We were a top town in Johnson's field when she whispered that she wants me
At least there's a little bit of sweet in the bitter, though a part of me is always gonna miss it
I am who I am, I just miss who I was when we were

We were leather jackets, hangin' on to a Harley, two heartbeats in the moonlight
We were, both feet hanging out over the edge of the water tower skyline
At least there's a little bit of sweet in the bitter, though a part of me is always gonna miss her

"Look at my history
I'm trying to see what's different from that guy and the richer me
The only thing I see is custom owls from Tiffany
And some gunnas that'll hit you outta nowhere, like epiphany
Really that's it to me
Aside from the obvious, man, it changes in scenery
Testing me gon' have my niggas testing machinery
They say that they happy, my man, that's not how they seem to be
The boy, he wild and peaceful, rest in peace Teena Marie
Ethics and values, mob traditions, old fashioned
Monopoly action
Bronny buying up Brentwood like he still in Akron
A lot of pain, a lot of passion
A lot of relaxing while other niggas is overreacting
That's how we continue down the path of Jordan and Jackson
That's some insight for y'all even if no one's asking
Last year, niggas really feel like they rode on me
Last year, niggas got hot 'cause they told on me
I'm 'bout to call the bluff of anybody that fold on me
I'm buying the building of every door that closed on me
Yeah, Loro Piana and Brioni, the one and only
Champagne popper, the love doctor
Your baby mother call me when she lonely
My tailor see me twice a week, he like my homie
Forever grateful, forever thankful
Diamond necklace, but she wears it on her ankle
The bitch is trendy
My enemies send each other the texts that they could never send me
I'm banking two million a show for the residency
Nevada gaming commission in a frenzy
How much money can this casino lend me?
Ripping markers up over shots of the Henny
Vivid memory, can someone send me
A real nigga interlude? To me, Benihana is pigeon food
This not a forgiving mood
So much, we gotta count the 20s up in a different room
I am just a body that my brothers are living through
Keeping my connections strictly physical
Everyone that's married is miserable
I know that that is not a lifestyle I can give into
The rise to the top of this mountain has been biblical
I don't carry cash 'cause the money is digital
It's the American Expresser, the debt collector
Hailing all the way from the Mecca
Got something for Trudy and Rebecca
This shit could last forever
The mind controller, the Ayatollah
I built a bridge to success and had visions of me riding over
Step in the room and October gets a lot closer
Haunted houses, I don't know how to count in thousands, only millions
Now tell your friends I'm not the villian
Send 'em to Lagos or Turks and Caicos
Barbados, Trinidad and Tobago
Never go the same places they go
Separate vacations, a far cry from when Drizzy had slept in the basement
I was never on the path to get into Cambridge
I mean, I was good at doing math, but I'm better with language
Borderline dangerous, approach with caution
I plan to buy your most personal belongings when they up for auction
Man, truth be told, I think about it often
The petty king, the overseer of many things
I wish that I was playing in a sport where we were getting rings
I wouldn't have space on either hand for anything
West Hollywood, know my presence is menacing
Cosa Nostra, shady dealings
Racketeering, the syndicate got they hand in plenty things
The things that we've done to protect the name are unsettling
But no regrets though, the name'll echo
Years later, none greater

This is a marathon and I’m aware
I been playing it back from a lack of promotions
I was never one for the bragging and boasting
I guess I was hoping the music would speak for itself, but the people want everything else
Ok, no problem, I’ll show up on everyone album
You know what the outcome will be
I'm batting a thousand
It’s got to the point that these rappers don't even like rappin' with me
Fuck it 'cause my nigga 21 Savage just hit me
And told me he saved me a spot on a new record he got
He call it ""a lot,"" I open my book and I jot
Pray for Tekashi, they want him to rot
I picture him inside a cell on a cot
’Flectin' on how he made it to the top
Wondering if it was worth it or not
I pray for Markelle 'cause they fucked up his shot
Just want you to know that you got it, my nigga
Though I never met you, I know that you special
And that the Lord blessed you, don't doubt it, my nigga
Dennis Smith, Jr. stay solid, my nigga
I'm on a tangent, not how I planned it
I had some fans that hopped and abandoned ship
When they thought that I wasn't gone pan out, I got a plan

I had to tighten the fuck up, but I'm here for the crown, crown, crown, crown
I was just fucked up, I was just down, down bad
Picked up the pad, picked up the slack
Pick of the litter, don't litter no bag
Bassy been pickin' up racks, raps comin' clearer than Acuvue 2
When I'm back in the booth
Got 'em hackin' a Shaq 'cause they lackin' the juice
Niggas droppin' the ball, they on Shaqtin' a Fool
Actavis drool down the side of your face
We ain't jackin' it, we ain't dappin' them fools
Get a napkin, you dudes is embarassin'
Who going crazy like us? No comparison
Dreamville like Marion Jones on the steroids
Y'all niggas slow as a heroin high
Y'all had a year, y'all had a year
Y'all had a year, but you let it go by
Yee
I was just fucked up, I was just down, down bad
I had to tighten the fuck up, but I'm here for the crown, crown (Oh, shit)
I was just fucked up, I was just down, down bad
I had to tighten the fuck up, but I'm here for the crown, crown, crown, crown
Dreamville head honcho
Bitch, we came from nothin' just like the big bang theory
That poverty stains kept the pain buried
And covered the shame with a dream
We would have fortune and fame
A mil' in the bank, chameleon paint turned cranberry
Now little Jermaine got the same story
As that boy out of St. Vincent-St. Mary: G.O.A.T.
All hail King Cole, first of his name, long may he reign
The boy got the throne, but you know it ain't a game
Ville nigga, I was born in the same
Pressure cooker that's been known to bust a lump of coal and make a diamond
Two six, we enrolled in Reaganomics
Crew sick, we the Golden State of rhyming, on God
You could die today, so be hell to pay
I'm a livin', breathin', schemin' testimony
So don't test me, homie, put that in ya, homie
Put a foot up that ass, you a steppin' stone
All my niggas ain't gettin' no sleep
All of my niggas be chasin' their dreams
Ooh, I'm a force of nature, I can't wait to date ya
I was havin' problems 'til I had to break through
All my tattoos for sure, they ain't never for show
Might get tattoo'd on tour, tell ya ho get the door
Spend my time makin' love to your thoughts
Gon' get in line, baby, slut up your mind
It's a brand new season, I'm a righteous heathen
I take on the challenge and I leave it bleedin'
I was down bad, now I'm even Steven
And I'm leavin', leavin' every fuckin' weekend (Oh)
I was just fucked up, I was just down, down bad
I had to tighten the fuck up, but I'm here for the crown, crown (Oh, shit)
I was just fucked up, I was just down, down bad

"We be throwin' money in a spiral
Every time your girl hear my song, yeah, turn her right into my hoe
She shake her ass, do the eye roll
Got a skinny thong like a tightrope
I be blowin' up like some pyro
Coupe 150, call it Kyro
If she left with me, she the right hoe
Man, she ridin' me like a BMX
Man, she said the D is for Dyno
I got two horns like a rhino
It's no way you can buy hoe
But I bought a mansion with the sly dough
Yes, I opened up the slide doors, so you can hear me hit the high note

I like the way
You do it (Ayy)
You do it (Ayy)
You do it (I'm working on dying, ayy)
You do it (Ayy)
You do it (Ayy)
You do it (Ayy)

Money keep coming in, I can't lose
Money keep coming in, I can't lose
Foreign girls and they tens, I can't choose
Foreign car got V10, I can't cruise

I got different color on my diamonds, I can't even see the time
I don't wanna see her face, I'ma go and get behind
Drop the top on the Wraith, I'ma make him lose his mind
I just made 100k, it was quicker than a Vine
I was swinging on my vine, tryna put me down, but I climb
I'ma get it, keep tryin', there's no reason for the cryin'
We the ones that be slidin', they the ones that be dyin'
Know my boys, they be ridin', yeah, my doors suicide

Side note, you will never reach my goals
I be walkin' with a slimed nose
And I'm also walkin' with my side hoe
Only time I be walkin' when I'm on the moon, so I feel like Michael
I was talking to my lil' slime, that's a lil' lizard, call her Geico
In reality I'm 5'4
Stand on my money now I'm 6'6
Hit her once now she dismissed
Can't fuck her sister make her lick dick
.40 on me make my hip thick
When I see an opp, make the clip hit
Aiming at his top, boy you need a mop
Man I'm goin' out with a vengeance
My pants, Raf Simons
My shoes, Rick-Rick
Your girl dipped my tartar sauce so she ate my dick like a fish stick
Hit it raw, yes I am a dog, I don't do this shit for no image
All my diamonds, they be hittin' hard
Try to play me boy, that's a scrimmage

I got different color on my diamonds, I can't even see the time
I don't wanna see her face, I'ma go and get behind
Drop the top on the Wraith, I'ma make him lose his mind
I just made 100k, it was quicker than a Vine
I was swinging on my vine, tryna put me down, but I climb
I'ma get it, keep tryin', there's no reason for the cryin'
We the ones that be slidin', they the ones that be dyin'
Know my boys, they be ridin', yeah, my doors suicide

Live it up, you can just go any day now
Mykko Montana, this beat is from K Camp
Got frost on my diamonds, I'm getting the cake now
I stand on your stomach lil' bitch when you lay down
Live it up, cause you can go any day now
Mykko Montana, this beat is from K Camp
Frost on my diamonds 'cause I got the cake now
When you on your stomach lil' bitch better you lay down
I'm so up and I can't turn it down
They counted me out, my whole life turned around
Clean up my diamonds, you know I got rented
Know my boys coming and you know they mean business
That advance that you waitin' for, already spent it
When I'm on the beat man, you know I'm gon' kill it

We be throwin' money in a spiral
Every time your girl hear my song, yeah, turn her right into my hoe
She shake her ass, do the eye roll
Got a skinny thong like a tightrope
I be blowin' up like some pyro
Coupe 150, call it Cairo

I got different color on my diamonds, I can't even see the time
I don't wanna see her face, I'ma go and get behind
Drop the top on the Wraith, I'ma make him lose his mind
I just made 100k, it was quicker than a Vine
I was swinging on my vine, tryna put me down, but I climb
I'ma get it, keep tryin', there's no reason for the cryin'
We the ones that be slidin', they the ones that be dyin'

You do it (Ayy)
You do it (Ayy)
You do it (I'm working on dying)
